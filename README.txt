This project of Tetris was built by Virat Singh, Eli Wrenn, and David Boatwright.

The code for this project is written in C++, and we have utilized Qt to develop the GUI.

To run the project, simply open the Painter.pro file in QT Creator and Click run. A new window will open and the game is immediately playable. Because the app utilizes QT Creator, it can be played on any system with QT Creator installed although it was exclusively designed and tested on Mac OSX.

The project is an emulation of Tetris, offering the player more control over various aspects of the game. For example, the speed of the blocks is customizable, as is the dimensions of the board, and so on.
